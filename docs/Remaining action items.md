- (In-progress) Query GitHub or GitHub Enterprise for any pending workflow runs.
- Periodically query each machine to gather its state:
	- Whether the machine is up or down
	- How many jobs are being run
	- If there are any finished or crash jobs that need clean-up
- If there is a pending workflow item:
	- Choose the least loaded machine.
	- (Done) Connect to it via SSH.
	- (Done) Launch a new self-host runner container, so it picks up the job.
- If there are any finished, crashed, or long-running containers:
	- Connect to it via SSH.
	- Destroy the containers to free up the disk space.
- If necessary, update the self-hosted runner's container image.
